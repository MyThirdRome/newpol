# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Current Status

All files are committed locally in the git repository at:
`/workspaces/polymarket-orderbook-monitor`

## To Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Push to existing Polymarket-spike-bot-v1 repo

```bash
cd /workspaces/Polymarket-spike-bot-v1
git push origin main
```

This will push the orderbook-monitor as a subdirectory.

### Option 2: Create new repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `polymarket-orderbook-monitor`
   - Make it public or private
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push to the new repository:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/polymarket-orderbook-monitor
git remote add origin https://github.com/MyThirdRome/newpol.git
git push -u origin main
```
