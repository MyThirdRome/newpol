# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Current Status

All files are committed locally in the git repository at:
`/workspaces/polymarket-orderbook-monitor`

## To Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Push to existing Polymarket-spike-bot-v1 repo

```bash
cd /workspaces/Polymarket-spike-bot-v1
git push origin main
```

This will push the orderbook-monitor as a subdirectory.

### Option 2: Create new repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `polymarket-orderbook-monitor`
   - Make it public or private
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push to the new repository:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/polymarket-orderbook-monitor
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polymarket-orderbook-monitor.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Files Ready to Push

✅ All application files
✅ Installation script (`install.sh`)
✅ Deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
✅ Documentation (README.md, USAGE.md, STATUS.md)
✅ .gitignore configured
✅ No sensitive data included

## After Pushing

Update the DEPLOYMENT.md file with the correct repository URL:
```bash
# Replace this line in DEPLOYMENT.md:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polymarket-orderbook-monitor/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Fresh Server Installation Command

Once pushed, users can install with:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polymarket-orderbook-monitor/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polymarket-orderbook-monitor.git
cd polymarket-orderbook-monitor
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
